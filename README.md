# PyBer_Analysis
## 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
### The scope of this analysis was go through a set of PyBer data and visualize it. This would be used as baseline to promote equal access to ride-sharing services while maintaining affordability for all different types of cities, urban, suburban, and rural.

## 2. Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

### Figure 1 - Total Fare by city type

### Based on the image above, it appears that the majority of the revenues comes from rides in urban areas. Ride sharing services account for about 69% of total rides and 63% of the total revenue (see figure 2 below). Rural and suburban area appear to somewhat correlate to one another by 1:2 ration.

## 3. Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
### Key takeaway from this analysis
### 1. Urban cities provide the majority of the income, therefore drivers are paid more.
### 2. Rural customers pay more than surburban and urban areas while having the less drivers from the other two types of cities (see figure 3 below)

### In order to get a broader perspective on the issue, it would be ideal to look at a bigger set of data to better identify trends and possibly other factors that could affect price changes. Holiday periods tend to greatly affect ride sharing prices depending on cities and drivers' availability. The company may alsotry to bring additional incentives to get drivers from urban areas to support suburban and rural areas. This would increase revenues and average drivers' fare.
